# nano-materials
We deposite c++ code for analyzing nano materials. 

vasp_poscar_parser.c=code the input a vasp poscar file and output the distances between atoms and distance distribution. 

Abstract: 
   Here we consider complex materials such as liquid silicon, nano-porous silicon carbide, aluminosilicates, and others. The goal is to create a computer code to detect bond and bonding defects in complex materials. We begin by examines structures from publicly available repositories. Then, we plot bond distribution histograms. By examining, the histograms, we develop an algorithm to identify bonding versus non-bonding atoms. We apply this code to identify defects in complex materials.
