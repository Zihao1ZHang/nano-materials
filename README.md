# nano-materials
We deposite c++ and python code for analyzing nano materials. 

The goal of this project is to detect bond and bonding defects in the complex material.

c++:
vasp_poscar_parser.c=code the input a vasp poscar file and output the distances between atoms and distance distribution. 

python:
input the distance distribution file and output the histogram and cutoff distance.
